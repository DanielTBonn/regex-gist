# Title (replace with your title)

Regex is an important search tool that programmers can use to help identify patterns that arise in strings or text. To those of us who are newer to programming it can look like indigestable gibberish only the computers can hope to comprehend. However, after taking some time to learn the patterns it actually is quite simple and can become a powerful tool in our programming toolkit. To help understand regex and possibly pass on this knowledge to other new programmers trying to make sense of these cryptic patterns, I have set out to explain what it's components do. To do this, I will use a specific example and relay the purpose of every individual part of the expression and what the results will be for different expressions. 

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

Regular expressions, or regex, actually comes from the mathematical concept of regular sets.

## Regex Components

A regex is considered a literal, so in javascript the pattern must be wrapped in slash characters `/`.

### Anchors

^ and $ are 'anchored' to the front and back of the regex respectively

### Quantifiers

Sets the limit of the string our regex matches, includes min and max number of characters that our regex is looking for.
Are inherently greedy, meaning they match as many of occurences of particular patterns as possible.

### OR Operator

Like with the bracket operators, the OR operator can match expressions such as `[abc]` in the same manner using `(a|b|c)`

### Character Classes

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references
